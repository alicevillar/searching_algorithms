# SIMPLE VERSION:

def search(list,n):
    for i in range(len(list)):
        if list[i] == n:
            print(i)
    return -1
list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
n = 7
search(list,n)

# ANOTHER VERSION:

# Python3 code to linearly search x in arr[].
# If x is present then return its location,
# otherwise return -1

#Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
#If x matches with an element, return the index.
#If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

def search(arr, n, x):
    for i in range(0, n):
        if (arr[i] == x):
            return i
    return -1


# Driver Code
arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]
x = 10
n = len(arr)

# Function call
result = search(arr, n, x)
if (result == -1):
    print("Element is not present in array")
else:
    print("Element is present at index", result)

    #Output = Element is present at index 3
