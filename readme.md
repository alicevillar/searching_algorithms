<h1>Searching Algorithms </h1>

> This repository contains a personal study of the following search algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search and Jump Search. 
 
## Files

### Linear Search 

* [linear_search_v1.py](https://github.com/alicevillar/Searching_Algorithms/blob/main/linear_search/linear_search_v1.py) => This algorithm compares the target number with each element of the array. If the target number is present then return its location.
 
* [linear_search_v2.py](https://github.com/alicevillar/Searching_Algorithms/blob/main/linear_search/linear_search_v2.py) => In this second version, if the target element is present in the list more than once, the function will return all the locations. 

* [linear_search_v3.py](https://github.com/alicevillar/Searching_Algorithms/blob/main/linear_search/linear_search_v3.py)


### Binary Search 



### Roadmap 

In the future, I intend to include the following algorithms in this repository:

* Fibonacci Search
* The Ubiquitous Binary Search
* Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array
* Recursive function to do substring search
* Unbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time)
