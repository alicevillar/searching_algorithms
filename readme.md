# Searching Algorithms 


1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Jump Search
 
 Note that although the target number (10) is present in index 5 and 8, the output is 5

 

### Roadmap 

In the future, I intend to include the following algorithms in this repository:

* Fibonacci Search
* The Ubiquitous Binary Search
* Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array
* Recursive function to do substring search
* Unbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time)
